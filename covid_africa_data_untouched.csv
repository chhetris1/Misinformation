So the story surrounding the outbreak in Wuhan is obscure, definitely a human is involved. Media is using fear mongering and propaganda to afflict people. Some people or even organizations and nations stand to benefit or are profiting from the outbreak and are responsible in its rapid spread.
Measures put in place are not effective in Africa because they are not contextualized, lack government supportive measures to help people implement them, and do not aim at solving or even considering (but rather compound) the myriad of other problems that plague the African society (social, economic, health, institutional etc).

And the scientific community and authorities are not entirely honest or open with information relating to covid treatment etc, economics and politics is clogging everything",Teh Jervis Ngong
